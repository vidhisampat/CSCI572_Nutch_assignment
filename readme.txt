We have 1 .java file named PDFExtractor.java in the pdfextract folder.
We have made changes in 4 configuration files namely nutch-site.xml, regex-urlfilter.txt, seeds.txt and regex-normalize.xml. We have also included another important file namely nutch-default.xml

To complie the code execute the following command:
javac PDFExtractor.java

To run the code execute the following command:
java PDFExtractor <Crawl Directory> <Output Directory>

The crawl directory must contain the path upto the segments folder for example the crawl directory must be something like "C:\Users\nidhijain1208\Desktop\crawl\segments"
The output directory can be the path of the folder in which you want to store the extracted PDF files.
